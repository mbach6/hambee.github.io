---

_Forgotten Seasons is a series dedicated to recognizing the greatness of players who may not have gotten the recognition they deserved in their day. Today, we're looking at Colorado Rockies first baseman Todd Helton's incredible 2000 season._  

__Key Stats:__ _8.9 WAR, .372 BA, .463 OBP, .698 SLG, 1.162 OPS, 216 H, 59 2B,_ 42 HR, _147 RBI, 138 R,_ 61 K, 103 BB _(Italics indicate a league leading stat.)_

> The 2000 season marked the first of five consecutive All-Star seasons for Helton. These were also the only All-Star appearances of his 17-year career despite hitting .293/.393/.459 over his final 9 seasons.  

Todd Helton was an absolute machine during the 2000 season. He torched opposing pitchers to the tune of a .383/.479/.701 slash line through the season's first half and followed this up with a cool .362/.446/.695 in the second half. So he was dominating at the plate for the entirety of the year.

So did Todd Helton win the NL MVP? The answer is no. Actually, he didn't even crack the top 3 in terms of voting totals. He finished 5th on the ballot with a single first place vote. This is almost certainly a result of the bias against pre-humidor Coors Field. But it’s worth noting that Helton led the National League in WAR for the season which accounts for ballpark factors, so the additional emphasis on the Coors Effect is misleading.

> Besides 2000, Todd Helton only led the National League in one other offensive category at any other point in his career when he posted a .445 OBP in 2005.

There is no doubt Helton benefited from playing in Coors. He batted .391/.484/.758 in 81 games there (to go along with 27 HR and 88 RBI. The man basically had an MVP-caliber season just at home.) But in 79 games on the road, he had a robust .353/.441/.633 with 15 HR and 59 RBI. So not only did he win a batting title, but he had the black ink stats and road splits to reinforce his offensive dominance.

And while this was an offense-oriented league at the time, Helton’s 163 adjusted OPS+ is an indicator that he was in the highest echelon of hitters, trailing only Barry Bonds (188 OPS+) and Gary Sheffield (176 OPS+) in the National League and actually besting NL MVP Jeff Kent’s 162 OPS+.

> Despite only leading the league in OBP in two seasons, Helton's .414 career OBP ranks 27th on the all-time list behind Hall of Famer Jesse Burkett (.415 OBP) and tied with Hall of Famer Mel Ott.

Not only was Helton a showstopper with the bat, he flashed the leather too with the stellar defense he contributed at first base. By Total Zone Runs, he ranked 1st in the Majors among first basemen with 18 runs above average saved, outpacing the next best in the MLB (Mark Grace) by 6 runs. His 18 TZR actually ranked third across all positions in the NL behind only center fielder Andruw Jones (25 TZR) and catcher Mike Matheny (19 TZR). In fact, at the time, Helton’s 18 TZR tied the best single-season mark ever by a first baseman (which would later be eclipsed by Albert Pujols in 2007 with 27 TZR). 

But curiously, Todd Helton did not win the Gold Glove at first base in 2000. Instead, he lost the award to JT Snow, a capable fielder but one who didn’t even crack the top 10 in terms of TZR for the year 2000. However, Helton's lack of denfensive hardware would be rectified as he would win the Gold Glove in 2001 and 2002. So chalk up world-class defense to complement an already ludicrous offensive showing.

> For his career, Todd Helton was one of the rare players who walked more than he struck out, having been granted first base 160 more times than he whiffed. He ranks 208th on the all-time strikeout list (1175 K) and 36th on the all-time base-on-balls list (1335 BB). Of the 35 players ahead of Helton on the all-time base-on-balls list at the time of this post, 31 are eligible for the Hall of Fame and 25 of those 31 are already enshrined in Cooperstown.

The only two players in all of baseball who topped Helton in terms of WAR were the utterly transcendent Pedro Martinez (11.7 WAR) whose 2000 season ranks among the very best single-season pitching performances in history and the analytics darling Alex Rodriguez (10.4 WAR) whose legacy is marred by his use of performance enhancing substances. But both Martinez and Rodriguez played in the American League, leaving Helton as the undisputed WAR champion of the National League.

And for curiosity’s sake, NL MVP Jeff Kent posted a 7.2 WAR, good for 5th in the NL behind Helton (8.9 WAR), Andruw Jones (8.2 WAR), Randy Johnson (8.1 WAR), and Barry Bonds (7.7 WAR). The main disparity in the voting results between Kent and Helton? Kent’s San Fransisco Giants went 97-65 on their way to a 1st place finish in the NL West while Helton’s Colorado Rockies went 82-80 while limping their way to a 4th place finish in the NL West.

> Todd Helton's 106 career Total Zone Runs rank second all-time for first basemen behind only Keith Hernandez (120 TZR) and tied with Albert Pujols. By this metric, Helton could be considered one of the best defensive first basemen ever.

One final note: Helton’s single-season 59 doubles ranks 7th in MLB history and were, and remain, the most by a player since 1936. And before you ask, he hit 28 of those doubles at Coors and the other 31 on the road. 

This sensational season for the 2000 NL Batting Champion and Hit King deserved a deeper dive. His is surely one of the most remarkable forgotten seasons in MLB history.

> Todd Helton was good, and he should be in the Hall of Fame. That's not a statistic, but it is my opinion.
