title: "Curiosity Corner: John Smoltz - Super Starter?"
---

_Curiosity Corner is a series dedicated to thought experiments that speculate what players may have achieved if circumstances were different from reality. Today, we're looking at Hall of Fame pitcher John Smoltz's time as the game's premier closer._  

__Career Stats:__ 69.0 WAR, 213 Wins, 155 Losses, 154 Saves, 3.33 ERA, 3473.0 Innings, 3084 K/1010 BB, 1.176 WHIP

> When Tommy John surgery threatened to derail his career, John Smoltz responded by transtioning from one of the baseball's most dominant starters to breaking the National League record for saves in a single season (55), a record which still stands today and is tied only by Eric Gange.

Are you familiar with the stat FIP? 

It stands for Fielding Independent Pitching. It's essentially an ERA estimation that measures how good a pitcher is (or isn’t) in spite of their defense. It’s also measured so that each season the league average FIP is the same as the league average ERA. It can essentially tell you how lucky or unlucky a pitcher is because of his defense. 

The 2018 Atlanta Braves pitchers benefited a ton from great defense. So while Braves starter Mike Foltynewicz had a 2.85 ERA, he had a 3.37 FIP, meaning that he’d be closer to the latter number with a more league-average defense. 

By contrast, 2018 Boston Red Sox starter Chris Sale had a 2.11 ERA but a 1.98 FIP which suggested he was burnt some by poor defense. (He’s not complaining though; he just won a World Series.)

So FIP can basically tell us a story of a pitcher’s ability better than an ERA can. And most times, it evens out over the course of a career due to a regression towards the mean. 

For example, Max Scherzer’s career ERA is 3.22 and his FIP is 3.19. Justin Verlander’s ERA: 3.39, his FIP: 3.42. It’s pretty consistent.

But there are a few standouts.

Tom Glavine had a career 3.54 ERA but a career 3.95 FIP. This is a product of the insane number of homers he gave up and his low strikeout totals. Of course, the Braves accounted for his crafty groundball nature by providing excellent defenders to back him which is why his ERA didn’t balloon more.

> Tom Glaine was a standout in both baseball and hockey while growing up in Massachusetts. After being drafted by the Los Angeles Kings in the 4th round (69th overall) of the 1984 NHL Entry Draft, he chose to the play baseball when the Atlanta Braves drafted him in the 2nd round (47th overall) of the 1984 MLB Amateur Draft. Interestingly, he wore 47 for the duration of his Major League career.

Greg Maddux conversely has a career 3.16 ERA and a 3.36 FIP. He had higher strikeout rates than Glavine and he pitched a lot more innings with fewer walks, which FIP rewards. (Side note: From 1986-2004, Greg Maddux went 305-174 with a 2.95 ERA and a 3.19 FIP. From 2005-2008, he’d follow with a 50-53 record and a 4.20 ERA. But his FIP? 3.88. Less than Tom Glavine’s career FIP.)

> Greg Maddux was drafted in 1984, the same year as Tom Glavine, by the Chicago Cubs in the 2nd round (31st overall). Curiously, he also wore 31 as his jersey number for the duration of his career until his late career stints with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2006 and 2008 when he wore 36 and with the San Diego Padres in 2007 and 2008 when he wore 30.

But the most interesting part of all of this is John Smoltz and his 3.33 career ERA. When you think of John Smoltz, you likely think dominance. But do you necessarily think better than Greg Maddux, the Professor, the oft-cited greatest pitching talent of all-time? At 3.24, John Smoltz career FIP is 0.02 points better than Maddux. But this is considering he did have 4 years of bullpen work with 285.1 innings of a 2.47 FIP. Relievers tend to have better run prevention numbers than starters since their workload is typically lighter over the course of a season on a per0inning basis.

However, this bullpen period for Smoltz was coming off a missed season of Tommy John recovery, and in the three seasons prior, he had an average of 203.1 innings pitched with a 3.04 ERA and 2.98 FIP. 

Now, far be it for me to say he would have seen this same success if he hadn’t had to undergo Tommy John and remained a starter for these 4 years. But if we hypothesize that from his lost season to his return to the rotation in 2005 at age 38 that he _did_ have these averages continue (not a terrible assumption consider he had a 3.04 ERA/2.98 FIP in 229.2 innings in his return-to-rotation season). So let’s say he didn’t get hurt and we extrapolate this pace over 5 years. So we have 5 years at 203.1 innings with a 3.04 ERA and a 2.98 FIP to replace the lost season and bullpen years.

> John Smoltz was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 22nd round (574th overall) in the 1985 MLB Amateur Draft. I wish I could tell you he wore jersey number 574, but it's simply not the case. He actually wore 29 for most of his career. But in a strange twist, he made his debut as number 57, which is 574 truncated at the ten's place.

That takes away the 285.1 innings of a 2.47 FIP and replaces it with 1016.2 innings of a 3.04 ERA and a 2.98 FIP. Is it enough to offset the benefit of the coming out of the pen? It turns out yes.

If we take John Smoltz career and replace the TJ season and him as a receiver with these aggregated stats from the three seasons prior to his TJ, we have…

4202.2 career innings with a 3.30 ERA and, more importantly, a 3.23 FIP, better than Greg Maddux's career 3.26 FIP. So starter or not, John Smoltz, by measure of FIP, may have been better than both Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux.

Maybe we missed out on John Smoltz: 300-game winner. But he does remain the only player in MLB history with 200+ wins and 150+ saves, and that never would have been possible without his need for Tommy John. So, in the end, I think it all worked out for Smoltzy. He is, and always will be, a legend.

> This piece was inspired by seeing John Smoltz dining out at a restaurant in Roswell, GA. He was gracious, courteous, and friendly with fans, and he was especially kind to a stat rat like me. He is one of the nicest folks you could ever meet, and I hope he'd get a kick out of me saying he's better than his old pals.
