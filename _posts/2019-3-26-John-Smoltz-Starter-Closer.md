title: "Curiosity Corner: John Smoltz - Super Starter?"
---

_Curiosity Corner is a series dedicated to thought experiments that speculate what players may have achieved if circumstances were different from reality. Today, we're looking at Hall of Fame pitcher John Smoltz's time as the game's premier closer._  

__Career Stats:__ 69.0 WAR, 213 Wins, 155 Losses, 154 Saves, 3.33 ERA, 3473.0 Innings, 3084 K/1010 BB, 1.176 WHIP

Are you familiar with the stat FIP? It’s Fielding Independent Pitching. It's essentially an ERA estimation that measures how good a pitcher is (or isn’t) in spite of their defense. It’s also measured so that each season the league average FIP is the same as the league average ERA. It can essentially tell you how lucky or unlucky a pitcher is because of his defense. 

The 2018 Atlanta Braves pitchers benefited a ton from great defense. So while Braves starter Mike Foltynewicz had a 2.85 ERA, he had a 3.37 FIP, meaning that he’d be closer to the latter number with a more league-average defense. 

By contrast, 2018 Boston Red Sox starter Chris Sale had a 2.11 ERA but a 1.98 FIP which suggested he was burnt some by poor defense. (He’s not complaining though; he just won a World Series.)

So FIP can basically tell us a story of a pitcher’s ability better than an ERA can. And most times, it evens out over the course of a career due to a regression towards the mean. 

For example, Max Scherzer’s career ERA is 3.22 and his FIP is 3.19. Justin Verlander’s ERA: 3.39, his FIP: 3.42. It’s pretty consistent.

But there are a few standouts.

Tom Glavine had a career 3.54 ERA but a career 3.95 FIP. This is a product of the insane number of homers he gave up and his low strikeout totals. Of course, the Braves accounted for his crafty roundball nature by providing excellent defenders to back him which is why his ERA didn’t balloon more.

Greg Maddux conversely has a career 3.16 ERA and a 3.36 FIP. He had higher strikeout rates than Glavine and he pitched a ton more innings with fewer walks, which FIP rewards. (Side note: From 1986-2004, Greg Maddux went 305-174 with a 2.95 ERA and a 3.19 FIP. From 2005-2008, he’d follow with a 50-53 record and a 4.20 ERA. But his FIP? 3.88. Less than Tom Glavine’s career FIP.)

But the most interesting part of all of this is John Smoltz and his 3.33 career ERA. When you think of John Smoltz, you think dominance. But do you think better than Maddux? At 3.24, John Smoltz career FIP is 0.02 points better than Maddux. This is considering he did have 4 years of bullpen work with 285.1 innings of a 2.47 FIP. But this is coming off a missed season with Tommy John and in the three seasons before that he had an average of 203.1 innings pitched 3.04 ERA and a 2.98 FIP. 

Now, far be it for me to say he would have seen this same success if he hadn’t had to undergo Tommy John and remained a started for these 4 years. But if we hypothesize that from his lost season to his return to the rotation in 2005 at age 38 that he did have these averages continue (not a terrible assumption consider he had a 3.04 ERA/2.98 FIP in 229.2 innings in his return-to-rotation season). So let’s say he didn’t get hurt and we extrapolate this pace over 5 years. So we have 5 years at 203.1 innings with a 3.04 ERA and a 2.98 FIP to replace the lost season and bullpen years.

That takes away the 285.1 innings of a 2.47 FIP and replaces it with 1016.2 innings of a 3.04 ERA and a 2.98 FIP. Is it enough to offset the benefit of the coming out of the pen? It turns out yes.

If we take John Smoltz career and replace the TJ season and him as a receiver with these aggregated stats from the three seasons prior to his TJ, we have…

4202.2 career innings with a 3.30 ERA and a 3.23 FIP. So starter or not, John Smoltz, by measure of FIP, may have been better than Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux both.

> Todd Helton was good, and he should be in the Hall of Fame. That's not a statistic, but it is my opinion.
