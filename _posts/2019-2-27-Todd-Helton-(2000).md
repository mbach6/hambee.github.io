_Forgotten Seasons is a series dedicated to recognizing the greatness of players who may not have gotten the recognition they deserved in their day. Today, we're looking at Colorado Rockies first baseman Todd Helton's incredible 2000 season._

Key Stats: __8.9 WAR, .373 BA, .463 OBP, .698 SLG, 1.162 OPS, 216 H, 59 2B,__ 42 HR, __147 RBI, 138 R,__ 61 K, 103 BB

Todd Helton was an absolute machine during the 2000 season. But his MVP placement? 5th. He got a single first place vote. This is certainly a result of the bias against pre-humidor Coors Field. But it’s worth noting that WAR standardizes by ballpark, so the additional emphasis on the Coors Effect is voided.

He definitely benefited from playing in Coors as he slashed .391/.484/.758 in 81 games there (along with 27 HR and 88 RBI so he basically already had an MVP season just at home), but in 79 games on the road, he had a robust .353/.441/.633 with 15 HR and 59 RBI. So not only did he win a batting title, but he had the black ink stats and road splits to reinforce his offensive dominance.

And while this was an offensive league at the time, Helton’s 163 adjusted OPS+ is an indicator that he was in the highest echelon of hitters, trailing only Barry Bonds (188 OPS+) and Gary Sheffield (176 OPS+) in the National League but actually besting NL MVP Jeff Kent’s 162 OPS+.

Not to be ignored is the stellar defense he put up at first base. By Total Zone Runs, he ranked 1st in the NL among 1B with 18 runs above average saved on the defensive side of the ball which outpaced the next best in the MLB (Mark Grace) by 6 runs. His 18 TZR actually ranked third overall in the NL after CF Andruw Jones (25) and C Mike Matheny (19). In fact, at the time, Helton’s 18 TZR tied the best single-season mark ever by a 1B (later broken by Albert Pujols in 2007 with 27 TZR). 

But curiously, Todd Helton did not win the Gold Glove at 1B in 2000, instead losing it to JT Snow who didn’t even crack the top 10 in TZR. This would be rectified though as Helton would win the Gold Glove in 2001 and 2002. So chalk up world-class defense to complement an already ludicrous offensive showing.

The only two players in all of baseball who topped Helton in WAR were the absolutely transcendent Pedro Martinez (11.7 WAR) whose 2000 season ranks among the very best in the history of baseball for pitching and the analytics darling Alex Rodriguez (10.4 WAR) whose own legacy is now in limbo due to his confirmed use of performance enhancing substances. But both of these players played in the American League, so Helton was the undisputed WAR champion of the National League.

And for curiosity’s sake, NL MVP Jeff Kent posted a 7.2 WAR, good for 5th in the NL behind Helton (8.9 WAR), Andruw Jones (8.2 WAR), Randy Johnson (8.1 WAR), and Barry Bonds (7.7 WAR). The main disparity in the voting results between Kent and Helton? Kent’s San Fransisco Giants went 97-65 on their way to a 1st place finish in the NL West while Helton’s Colorado Rockies went 82-80 while limping their way to a 4th place finish in the NL West.

One final note: Helton’s single-season 59 doubles ranks 7th in MLB history and were, and remain, the most by a player since 1936. And before you ask, he hit 28 doubles at home and 31 on the road. 

The 2000 NL Batting Champion and Hit King deserved a deeper dive. His is surely one of the most remarkable forgotten seasons in MLB history.
